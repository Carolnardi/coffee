      Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
      berries from certain Coffea species. All fruit must be further processed
      from a raw material—the fruit and seed—into a stable, raw product;
      un-roasted, green coffee. To process the berries, the seed is separated
      from the fruit to produce green coffee. Green coffee is then roasted, a
      process which transforms the raw product (green coffee) into a consumable
      product (roasted coffee). Roasted coffee is ground into a powder and mixed
      with water to produce a cup of coffee.<br /><br />

      Going back in time, we’ve seen that coffee is not just a drink. It’s a
      means of social interaction, and has been for a long time. In the past,
      people gathered together to share a cup of coffee and exchange
      information. <br /><br />
      Coffee and friends, coffee and work, coffee and snacks, coffee to go!
      There’s the Irish mix with whiskey called <em>“Irish Coffee”</em>. That
      makes us really curious to know more interesting facts about coffee as a
      beverage and as a part of everyday culture.
